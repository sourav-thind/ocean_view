This Repository consist of a ThreeJS Project which is Created by Souravpreet Singh. Vertex Shaders and GLSL is the main hero in this Scene as we created a very dangerously flowing ocean from a single plane, but calm down we alos gave you debug controls so that you can adjust the ocean and save our Ship which is a free CC 3D model making its way into the ocean. 

Feel free to fork the repository and do something of your own with this
